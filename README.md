## The problem:

- In this quickly developing world, We humans think only about ourselves.
- No one cares about abandoned and harmed animals.
- The vast majority of the NGOs and animal rescue center are understaffed.
- These things could lead demise of an innocent life.

## How it solves:

Initially, NGOs and Rescue centers need to enlist themselves on our application, In order to receive notification in case of emergency.

If there is any occurrence of accident, User needs to go to our web application and essentially send us the photograph of mishap and current location without sending his/her subtleties to dodge administrative work.

We have incorporated the photograph just to keep away from counterfeit reports.

Now the closest NGO will get a notification with the area of occurrence. So, that they can provide whatever care required.

Application is provided with a Google Map that pin points accident prone region to help NGOs keeping the track of incidents happening near them.
